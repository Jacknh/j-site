It's been severals months since my last post. I do things actively in a short period of time. I guess that's why I haven't succeeded in doing even one thing. Anyways, I want to talk about chords today.

Chords are to express emotions. A piece of music is like a journey. How to determine if the journey is a wonderful and pleasant experience? **Chords**. If a music is just the melody alone being involved, It would taste like a bottle water, nothing in it. Chords are like ingredients, different chords are different ingredients. You put these chords into your journey, you would feel it be colorful and interesting. So that's chords.

There are common chords and uncommon chords. Today I only cover common chords.

**Common chords**: triads/7th/9th/11th/13th chords. Let me detail them one by one.

### triads

A triad is the basic of everything! Any other chords are derived from a coresponding triad. So It is very important to get familiar with triads. Basicly It has a *major* type and a *minor* type.

``` md
- major
root -> major 3rd -> 5th
keywords: positive, active, a feeling of bright future.

- minor
root -> minor 3rd -> 5th
keywords: negative, sad, depressive feeling.

```

A music is mainly composed by seven tones. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Each tone can construct it's own chord, which has different style.

```md
1 -> tonic
chord: 1 3 5 -> major

2 -> supertonic
chord: 2 4 6 -> minor

3 -> mediant
chord: 3 5 7 -> minor

4 -> subdominant
chord: 4 6 1 -> major

5 -> dominant
chord: 5 7 2 -> major

6 -> submediant
chord: 6 1 3 -> minor

7 -> leading tone
chord: 7 2 4 -> diminished
```

### 7th chords

It is consisted of a triad chord. It means if you want a 7th chord, you must have a triad chord first, and then add a 7th tone behind it. But there are 2 kinds of 7th tone: *major 7th tone* and *minor 7th tone*. So we have two types of 7th chord, which are called *major 7th chord* and *7th chord*.

| triad\7th | minor 7th tone | major 7th tone |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| minor triad | X<sub>m</sub><sup>7</sup> | X<sub>m</sub><sup>maj7</sup> |
| major triad | X<sup>7</sup> | X<sup>maj7</sup> |

**note: X means any tones*

X<sub>m</sub><sup>7</sup> : 1 <sup>b</sup>3 5 <sup>b</sup>7

X<sub>m</sub><sup>maj7</sup> : 1 <sup>b</sup>3 5 7 (*uncommon*)

X<sup>7</sup> : 1 3 5 <sup>b</sup>7

X<sup>maj7</sup> : 1 3 5 7

I thought I would cover all common chords this time, but since it's already been a long reading, I think I will move the rest to next time. Chords are very complicated, It contains a lot! I didn't expect to end it one time, and also what I learned is just a piece of cake. I just write down some basic knowledge to help people memorize it.

Anyways thanks for reading! To be continue...
